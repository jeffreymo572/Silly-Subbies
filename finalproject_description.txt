Keyboard Interactivity (Yawer): The player can move the submarine with the use of 'wasd' and shoot with the space bar. I implemented an array of booleans for player inputs to allow for multiple keyboard inputs since processing only stores the last key the user inputted. This allows for diagonal movement as well as moving while shooting. I implemented acceleration-based movement to allow it to be a smoother experience. We also made the decision to have the submarine accelerate slower as it was going forward as a way to simulate going against a current. 

Data Input/Output (Yawer): I have implemented a highscore system to allow the saving and loading of a highscore. If the current run's score is higher than your highscore, it will save it as your new highscore and this will be loaded when you open the game again.
